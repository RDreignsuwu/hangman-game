# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game repository! This project is my first foray into the world of GitHub, and I’m excited to share my very own implementation of the classic word-guessing game.

## 🎮 About

Hangman is a popular word game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player one step closer to losing the game. Can you guess the word before time runs out?

This repository contains a simple, text-based Hangman game implemented purely in Python. The game features:

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Interactive gameplay with real-time feedback.
- Hangman stages that visually represent the number of remaining lives.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python yet, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/RDreignsuwu/hangman-game.git
cd hangman-game


### Install Dependencies

This game doesn’t require any external libraries beyond Python’s standard library. Simply ensure you have Python installed.

### Run the Game

To start the game, execute the following command in your terminal:
python hangman.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the letters and try to guess the word before you run out of lives.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `hangman.py`: The main script to play the Hangman game.
